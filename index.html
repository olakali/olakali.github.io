<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 80%">I am an Algorithm Engineer at <a href="https://x.company/" style="color:#C87606">X, the moonshot factory</a>, working with Project <a href="https://x.company/projects/taara/" style="color:#C87606">Taara</a>. </p>
    
  <p style="font-size: 80%">In May 2023, I defended my Ph.D. thesis titled <i>Algorithms for Human-Machine Communication in Assistive Robotics</i> at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/" style="color:#C87606">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. During my PhD, I was a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/" style="color:#C87606">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html" style="color:#C87606">Todd D. Murphey</a>. In 2021, I interned at Google DeepMind, working with <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~pilarski/" style="color:#C87606">Patrick Pilarski</a> and many others. I received a B.S. in Engineering from MIT in 2016 and an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2019. </p>

  <h3>Research Interests</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 80%">
    <!-- Assistive robots hold promise of being versatile collaborative companions, improving quality of life, particularly for individuals with physical impairments.  -->
    Assistive technology is often difficult to use and interact with, partly because it is challenging to specify flexible and intuitive languages for human-machine communication. <b>My research explores how to algorithmically facilitate cooperation.</b> I design algorithms that interpret human motion, coordinate joint actions, and enable a human-robot pair to co-create nonverbal languages. The goal is to enable human-robot dialogue using movement, touch, and physical interfaces, facilitating versatile collaboration.

    <!-- People, on the other hand, have exceptional capabilities to develop and adapt communication protocols that enable versatile collaboration. -->

    <!-- While people are incredibly good at communication and adaptation<span>&#8212;</span>enabling coordinated interaction, autonomous agents do not yet possess the same social skills. <b>My research explores how to algorithmically facilitate cooperation</b>, combining insights from human movement and cognitive science with optimal control, AI, and information theory. My PhD projects have focused on developing algorithms for physical human-machine cooperation in the context of assistive and rehabilitation robots. -->
