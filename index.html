<h2>About Me</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 80%">I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Northwestern University <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/" style="color:#C87606">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. I am a member of the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/" style="color:#C87606">Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Laboratory</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/murphey-todd.html" style="color:#C87606">Todd D. Murphey</a>. I recently interned at Google DeepMind, working with <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~pilarski/" style="color:#C87606">Patrick Pilarski</a> and many others. I received a B.S. in Engineering from MIT in 2016 and an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University in 2019. </p>

  <h3>Research Interests</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 80%">While people are incredibly good at communication and adaptation<span>&#8212;</span>enabling coordinated interaction, autonomous agents do not yet possess the same social skills. <b>My research explores how to algorithmically facilitate cooperation</b>, combining insights from human movement and cognitive science with optimal control, AI, and information theory. My PhD projects have focused on developing algorithms for physical human-machine cooperation in the context of assistive and rehabilitation robots.
